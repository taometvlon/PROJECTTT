                    In the last days of 2016, Mrs. M. Takako (71 years old, Japan) was brought to Vietnam by her family for treatment in the hope that "there is still water to slap". Suffering from glomerulonephritis at the age of 14, Takako underwent two kidney transplants in 1987 and 2004 in her hometown. Since 2014, she has returned to dialysis. "The doctor in Japan said that I am an elderly person, have had a kidney transplant twice, the blood vessels are more or less atherosclerotic, the connection for the kidney transplant requires high technology, so the third kidney transplant for me is almost impossible. impossible," said Mrs. Takako about her condition before the transplant.)

When the door to life gradually closed, Mrs. Takako knew about Vinmec hospital. At that time, although it had only been in operation for 5 years, Vinmec was mentioned by the medical world thanks to its many successes in treatment, including organ transplantation. After much deliberation, the family decided to bring Ms. Takako to Vietnam, choosing Vinmec as a place of treatment.

Lucky smiled at the Japanese female patient when the kidney transplant was successful. After only two weeks, Ms. Takako's health was stable. "In Japan, the oldest person to receive a kidney transplant is 72 years old. I am 71 years old, just had a third kidney transplant, almost the oldest person," said Ms. Takako.

The success of this kidney transplant has marked a new milestone for Vinmec hospital, and created opportunities for treatment for domestic and foreign patients in need of organ transplants.

                    On the other hand, Vinmec also contributes to changing people's views about hospitals in Vietnam by providing quality medical examination and treatment services and international healthcare experiences.

As one of the first women to give birth in Vinmec, Ms. Nguyen Phuong Lien (44 years old, Hanoi), said she gave birth to her first child in France and was impressed with the quality of healthcare in this country. When she returned to Vietnam to give birth to her second child, Ms. Lien also wanted her baby to have the same experience as the service in France, so she chose Vinmec.

"The care conditions here are no different from European hospitals, another plus point is that the doctors and nurses have sympathy, closeness and understanding because they are both Vietnamese," said Ms. Phuong Lien.

                    After a decade, Vinmec has become one of the largest private polyclinic systems in Vietnam with 7 hospitals and two international polyclinics in many provinces and cities. In which, there are two hospitals that meet JCI (USA) standards, which are safety standards for the purpose of improving the quality of patient care.

Along with expanding the scale, Vinmec said that it has also achieved many achievements in treatment, applying a series of advanced treatment methods in the world. Typically, in 2018, Vinmec successfully applied ultrasound-guided vertebral plane anesthesia (ESP) to replace morphine for pain relief in open-heart surgery, helping patients recover soon, hospital early and no pain after surgery.

After the third kidney transplant for a Japanese patient over 70 years old, Vinmec is also one of the first hospitals in Vietnam to successfully perform liver transplantation for children under 10 kg, partial heart transplant (LVAD). . The hospital also applies immunotherapy in cancer treatment, using surgical robots to treat cancer, digestive diseases... with a success rate of up to 95%.

                    Dr.BS Phung Nam Lam, Deputy General Director of Vinmec Health System, explained that this success comes from the focused investment right from the start in specialized, high-tech fields such as organ transplantation, cancer, cardiovascular, digestive, orthopedic trauma...

In 2016, Vinmec established a research institute specializing in stem cells and gene technology. After 5 years, the institute has published more than 50 research works in prestigious medical journals in the world such as STEM CELLS Translational Medicine or The Journals of Gerontology. In particular, there are works that have attracted the attention of the medical community such as publishing the Vietnamese gene map, detecting gene mutations in children with autism, genetic analysis of cancer diseases...

GS.TS.BS. Nguyen Thanh Liem, director of Vinmec Institute of Stem Cell and Gene Technology, said that medical research associated with hospitals is an inevitable trend of the world. These studies contribute to solving serious diseases, providing solutions to disease prevention, the basis of personalized medicine and precision medicine.

As a result, Vinmec has successfully performed a stem cell transplant to treat pulmonary fibrosis in premature babies around the world and a stem cell transplant to treat neurological sequelae caused by autoimmune encephalitis. Vinmec has also accepted research projects on stem cell transplantation for cerebral palsy and bone marrow mononuclear cell transplantation for autism, with over 90% of patients after transplantation having improved essential life skills.

In the field of Cardiology, Vinmec also gradually mastered many complex techniques. In December 2017, Vinmec was recognized as the first independent center in Vietnam for percutaneous aortic valve replacement (TAVI).
